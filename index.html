1. **2021 Belgian Grand Prix**: This Formula One race was notable for its lack of actual racing. Due to heavy rain, the event was reduced to three laps of caution, making it the shortest race in Formula One history.

2. **2018 Winter Olympics â€“ Freestyle Skiing**: Elizabeth Swaney, a Hungarian-American skier, competed in the halfpipe event despite being incapable of performing basic tricks. Her participation was widely covered due to her unusual skills and the controversy surrounding her inclusion.

3. **2012 Daytona 500**: The 54th running of the Daytona 500 did not finish until early Tuesday morning due to rain and a freak jet dryer accident. The event was delayed for several hours, causing it to extend into the night.`;
