1. **Rudy Gobert's COVID-19 Incident (2020)**
   During a media availability on March 9, 2020, Rudy Gobert touched every microphone and recording device in front of him, seemingly mocking the public's concern about COVID-19. Two days later, he tested positive for the virus, becoming the first NBA player to do so. This incident led to a significant disruption in the sports world as the NBA and other leagues suspended their seasons to mitigate the spread of the virus.

2. **The "Butt Fumble" Play (2012)**
   In a 2012 game between the New York Jets and the New England Patriots, Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez inadvertently collided with his teammate Brandon Moore, causing a fumble that was quickly picked up by Patriots' Steve Gregory and returned for a touchdown. This bizarre play, known as the "Butt Fumble," became a viral sensation and one of the most embarrassing moments in NFL history.

3. **Manute Bol's Unorthodox Shooting (1993)**
   During a 1993 game between the Philadelphia 76ers and the Phoenix Suns, center Manute Bol, known for his shot-blocking skills, unexpectedly showcased his ability to shoot from beyond the 3-point line. He connected on six 3-pointers, a feat unheard of for a player of his size at that time. This moment stunned fans and teammates alike, highlighting the unpredictability of sports.`;
