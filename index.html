1. **Randy Johnson's Bird Encounter**:
   In a 2001 baseball game, Hall of Fame pitcher Randy Johnson was involved in an extraordinary and tragic incident. As he released a fastball, a bird flew directly into the path of the pitch, causing it to explode in a cloud of feathers upon impact. This surreal moment left both players and fans in shock and highlighted the unpredictability of sports events[1].

2. **The "Butt Fumble" Play**:
   During a 2012 NFL game between the New York Jets and the New England Patriots, quarterback Mark Sanchez inadvertently collided with his own teammate, Brandon Moore, causing a fumble that was quickly scooped up by Patriots' Steve Gregory and returned for a touchdown. This bizarre play became infamous as the "Butt Fumble" and was widely ridiculed and replayed in sports media[1].

3. **Fan Man's Parachuting Incident**:
   In a 1993 heavyweight boxing match between Riddick Bowe and Evander Holyfield, an unexpected guest parachuted into the ring during the middle of the fight. The intruder, known as "Fan Man," descended from the sky wearing a parachute adorned with a large fan, disrupting the match and causing chaos among the fighters and spectators. This surreal incident remains one of the most bizarre moments in sports history[1].`;
